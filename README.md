# Idea of the project

The main objective of this research is to conduct a comparative analysis between two leading supermarket chains in Spain: DIA and Alcampo. In a context marked by the growing issue of menstrual poverty, which continues to affect a significant portion of the menstruating population, this study aims to shed light on the options available in the menstrual products market and their accessibility.

In this regard, our focus is not only on evaluating the prices offered by these supermarkets, but also on the variety and quality of menstrual products available. The aim is to provide menstruating individuals with a useful tool for making informed decisions about their purchases, directing them towards establishments that offer the best value for money and a wide range of options.

While this study focuses solely on these two supermarkets, there is the possibility of expanding its scope to include other similar establishments. Such an expansion could significantly enrich the final comparison and, consequently, the utility and relevance of the findings obtained.

With all this in mind, this research not only seeks to analyze price differences between supermarkets, but also aims to raise awareness about the importance of ensuring equitable and affordable access to menstrual products. Recognizing that menstrual poverty is a multifaceted challenge that requires multi-level actions, we hope that this study will contribute to fostering discussions and actions to address this issue more broadly in society.
